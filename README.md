# generative-art-gallery

The gallery art is coded with JavaScript and utilizes HTML Canvas.

> **First, what is code art?**    
> Code art is any art that is built using code.  
>    
> **What goes into a piece of generative art?**  
> Often, generative art draws inspiration from modern art, especially pop art that makes heavy use of orderly geometric patterns.  
>  
> * Randomness is crucial for creating generative art. The art should be different each time you run the generation script.  
> * Algorithms — As generative artists, we use code basics like loops, control flow and specialized functions.  
> * Geometry — Most generative art incorporates shapes, and the math from high school geometry class can aid in some really cool effects.
